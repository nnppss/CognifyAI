# CognifyAI: AI-Powered Learning Companion

This repository contains the source code for **CognifyAI**, a project designed to transform lecture videos into interactive learning companions.

## Project Overview

CognifyAI processes a given lecture video by extracting both spoken captions and on-screen text from key frames. It organizes this information into a searchable knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant context from the video and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an intelligent, context-aware answer.

This code provides a structural overview and simulation of the project's workflow, intended for demonstration purposes.

## How to Run

1.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the main simulation script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
